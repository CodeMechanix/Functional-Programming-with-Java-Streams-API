# Functional-Programming-with-Java-Streams-API

`Introduction`

- Stream API was introduced in Java 8.
- It is used to process the collections of objects.
- With Streams and Lambda functions, we can write clean, concise and understandable code.
- Streams is pipeline of operations, which we can use to evaluate the data.

Streams have intermediate and terminal operations which we can use as per our requirement. Hereâ€™s a list of Operations:

`Intermediate Operations:` *peek, *flatMap, limit, *sort, *distinct, *map, *filter etc

`Terminal Operations:` noneMatch, allMatch, collect, findAny, findFirst, anyMatch, toArray, reduce, min, max, forEach,
collect, count etc.
